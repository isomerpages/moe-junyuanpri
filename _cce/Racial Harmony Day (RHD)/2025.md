## Racial Harmony Day (RHD) 2025: “Our People, Our Tapestry”

Junyuan Primary School’s Racial Harmony Day (RHD) Programme 2025 served to deepen students’ appreciation of Singapore’s multicultural heritage and inspire them to play an active role in building a harmonious society. Themed “Our People, Our Tapestry,” this year’s celebration encouraged students to recognise how each individual contributes to the rich and colourful fabric of our nation.

The commemoration began with a captivating assembly show titled “Walk a Mile in My Shoe”, where students were guided to develop empathy by stepping into the shoes of others and reflecting on their lived experiences. Through storytelling and performance, the show challenged students to think about how their actions and words can promote understanding and inclusiveness.

Beyond the assembly, students engaged in a range of meaningful activities during recess time across two days on 18 and 21 July. The canteen buzzed with excitement as students played traditional games such as chapteh, five stones, hopscotch and kuti-kuti in culturally mixed groups, learning to collaborate and appreciate each other's strengths. These hands-on experiences provided students with valuable opportunities to come together to play and interact in a culturally diverse setting which is a part of our national identity.

At the Ecohub, students reflected on the theme of harmony and contributed their thoughts to a digital Harmony Wall, expressing what racial harmony means to them. Community singing sessions also returned this year with students gathering to sing familiar tunes that celebrate friendship and unity. The karaoke booth saw enthusiastic participation, with students singing in small groups, fostering friendships across races.

The engaging “Wheel of Harmony” and “Harmony Memory” games also offered students the opportunity to discuss ways to show respect, empathy and inclusivity in their daily lives, guided by student leaders and parent volunteers.

We were also delighted to welcome students from MOE Kindergarten @ Junyuan on 18 July and students from Pathlight School on 21 July, who joined us for the recess activities. It was heartening to see students from different schools learning and playing together, embracing the spirit of unity and friendship through shared cultural experiences.

At Junyuan Primary, we are committed to nurturing a generation that values diversity, treats others with respect and contributes actively to social harmony. Racial Harmony Day 2025 was a timely and joyful reminder that when we weave our differences together with care and kindness, we create a stronger, more united community.
