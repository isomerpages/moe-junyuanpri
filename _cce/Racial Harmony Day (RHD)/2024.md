## Racial Harmony Day (RHD) 2024

Junyuan Primary School’s Racial Harmony Day (RHD) Programme serves to deepen students’ learning to
understand and appreciate the diverse cultures in Singapore by showing respect and sensitivity in their
words and actions towards people from different cultures; and including one another graciously in work
and play.

Over the span of two days, students were engaged in a series of activities, both in class and out of class.
The commemoration started with a student-led mini-concert put together by the Music Interest Club, a
CCA group for students with a passion in music making, and the Cub Scouts. Drummers from the Music
Interest Club started the show with an electrifying multi-ethnic percussion performance, followed by a
showcase of two original songs on friendship composed by our talented singer-songwriters and the Cub
Scouts leading the school in the CEIMO CEIMO dance. The concert ended with MICs, as they are
affectionately called, leading the school in a mass singalong of popular local tunes.

We were honoured to have Senior Parliamentary Secretary, Mr Shawn Huang, joined a Primary 4 lesson
on ‘Harmony Begins With Me’ which students were facilitated to identify personal actions that can help
strengthen racial harmony as a Racial Harmony Champion through three scenarios - Playing Together,
Working Together and Eating Together.

During recesses on both days, Junyuan Primary School came alive with vibrant fringe activities facilitated
by the Parents Support Group (PSG), teachers and student leaders. Students participated in a variety of
hands-on traditional games such as chapteh, hopscotch, five stones, and kuti-kuti. These activities not
only provided entertainment but also gave our students a deeper insight into the diverse cultural
heritage that makes up our community. Through respectful communication and teamwork, students
learned the beauty of embracing differences while fostering a spirit of unity.

The celebrations also featured the joyous sounds of community singing, as students came together in
harmony to celebrate our shared values. The excitement continued with puzzle-building challenges,
where students worked collaboratively in groups of fours or fives, reinforcing the importance of
camaraderie and teamwork.

To further enrich their learning experience, students explored informative posters showcasing a variety
of foods from different cultures. They then tested their knowledge by answering related questions on
Kahoot, making the learning both interactive and fun.

At Junyuan Primary, we are committed to nurturing values of awareness, friendship, respect, and
harmony in our students. Racial Harmony Day was a wonderful reminder of the strength we derive from
our diversity and the importance of building a cohesive and vibrant school community.
