As part of their CCE lessons, P4 students learnt to show care for the needs of people in the school community.  In line with this, our P4 students embarked on a “Befriending the Non-Teaching Staff” VIA program.  

For the first part of the program, students learnt about what it means to be part of a school community, and what are some ways they can make the school community a better place to live, work and play in.   The students learnt to identify and understand the needs of the people in the school community, particularly the school’s non-teaching staff.  

With this insight, they worked in teams and embarked on a craft making project, where special hand-made gifts were prepared for the non-teaching staff, as a show of gratitude for their tireless contribution to the school.   Students then personally presented these exquisite gifts to the non-teaching staff, including the school cleaners, the canteen vendors, the school librarian etc.  The non-teaching staff beamed with much job when they received the hand-made gifts from the students, knowing that their efforts as members in our school community are recognised and appreciated.

It was indeed a meaningful learning experience for all the Primary 4 students who took part in this VIA program. The students are inspired to continue their contribution to our community.
