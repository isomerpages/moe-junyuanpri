## National Education (NE) Show 2025

On 12 July 2025, Junyuan Primary School’s Primary 5 students attended the National Education (NE) Show at the Padang. It was indeed an enjoyable and memorable day for the entire Primary 5 cohort and accompanying teachers who gathered to celebrate Singapore's 60th anniversary alongside with other schools and members of the public.

With their inflatable Thunder Clappers, the Primary 5 students waved their clappers high as they performed the traditional Kallang Wave at the Padang. They cheered loudly upon seeing some of their schoolmates, and even themselves, featured on the gigantic TV screen. It was a fantastic feeling to be a "TV celebrity" on such a special occasion, watched by about 25,000 spectators at the Padang.

Watching our national ‘heroes’ march into the Parade Square made all our Primary 5 students and accompanying teachers feel proud to be Singaporeans. The spectators seated along the aisle enjoyed the privilege of coming into close contact with the army personnel and Civil Defence officers as they walked up the stairs to exit the Parade Square. Some of our Primary 5 students were so inspired by this close interaction that they expressed their desire to serve in the Singapore Armed Forces. They cheered loudly for the Red Lions as they parachuted into the Parade Square.

The NDP concert comprised four acts, and our students particularly enjoyed Act Four of the concert segment because it brought the National Anthem to life, embodying the NDP 2025 theme "Majulah Singapura". It united the dreams and aspirations of individual Singaporeans with our shared resilience into our collective national destiny, beckoning Singaporeans to come together and shape the future as one.

As they sang along with the National Day songs, they were thrilled to see gigantic SG60 inflatable balls rolling towards them from the top of the seating areas. At this year's NDP, the Primary 5 students were treated to many rounds of brilliantly dazzling fireworks. The densely packed colours revealed a luminous, exciting spectrum that captivated everyone's eyes. Indeed, it was a marvelous night celebrating Singapore's 60th birthday at the Padang.
