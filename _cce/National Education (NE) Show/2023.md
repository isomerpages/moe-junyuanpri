### National Education (NE) Show 2023

8 July 2023 was a red-letter day for our Primary Five students! It was a once in a lifetime experience to participate in the NE Show at the Padang.

Our students squealed in delight when they received fancy sculpture balloons from the NE show motivators before the show began. And throughout the whole parade, they squealed in enthusiasm watching the various components of parade. They sang with gusto this year’s theme song “Shine Your light”. They wowed loudly when they saw themselves, first time ever, appearing on the gigantic TV screen of the parade. They cheered with pride as they watched the fighter jets fly over their heads and pumped their fists in the air when the Red Lions landed triumphantly on the parade square. Their confidence in the future of Singapore were boosted to a greater height as they watched the multitude of SAF, RSN and RSAF marched into the Parade Square, no doubt inspiring them to the next generation of our defenders.

Both teachers and students watched mesmerised as dancers in colourful costumes took centre stage to celebrate Singapore’s diverse and vibrant society. In the finale, they were enthralled by the very spectacular fireworks while waving their national flags to the tune of the theme song. This NE show in preparation to celebrate our Nation’s 58th birthday, will always have a place in the memory and hearts of our students. Surely it will cement in them the resolution to join, with all Singaporeans, to forge ahead as a united and strong people towards a better future. Onward As One!
