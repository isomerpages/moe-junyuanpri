## National Education (NE) Show 2024


As in many previous years, all Primary Five students attended the National Education show at the Padang on 6 July 2024. Undaunted by the occasional drizzle, our Primary Five students had a memorable and enjoyable evening at the Padang as they watched the performers singing and dancing to the NDP 2024 theme “Together, As One United People. The parade has definitely evoked the sense of patriotism amongst our students and enabled them to better appreciate the significance of National Day.
While making their way to the Padang, some of our Primary Five classes were the few privileged invited guests to witness the march-past by the RSAF outside the Padang. These students were heartened to meet our country’s Air Defender in such close proximity. 

Our students cheered with pride as they watched the fighter jets fly over their heads and pumped their fists in the air when the Red Lions landed triumphantly on the parade square. Their confidence in the future of Singapore were boosted to a greater height as they watched the multitude of SAF, RSN and RSAF marched into the Parade Square, no doubt inspiring them to be the next generation of our defenders.  

Throughout the whole parade, they squealed in enthusiasm watching the various components of parade while the lighted LED bracelets, given to them before the commencement of the NE show, synchronously lit the dark surrounding at the Padang as they sang the past years National Day songs with the performers. They wowed loudly as they joined the rest of the audience to greet our local artiste Benjamin Kheng making his charming appearance at the Padang. As Benjamin Kheng performed on stage, the 2024 NDP theme song “Not Alone”, our students sang along with him with gusto. 

Teachers and students watched mesmerised as dancers in colourful costumes took centre stage to celebrate Singapore’s collective strength in a diverse and vibrant society. In the finale, they were enthralled by the very spectacular fireworks while waving their national flags to the tune of the theme song. This NE show in preparation to celebrate our Nation’s 59th birthday, will always have a place in the memory and hearts of our students. Surely they are convinced that the spirit of inclusivity, community and trust has enabled all Singaporeans to overcome and flourish in the last 59 years despite the challenges.
