Total Defence Day 2024&nbsp;
-----------------------

This year TD40 marks 40 years of Total Defence (TD40) in Singapore.  An island-wide Total Defence exercise that simulated food, power disruptions, was carried in February in schools, businesses and buildings. As part of our commemoration of TD40 this year, Junyuan Primary students participated in a food disruption simulation in school on 15 February 2024. This TD40 Exercise aimed to prepare students for potential disruptions to our food supply chain due to climate change, protectionism, or geopolitical tensions etc., given Singapore’s reliance on food imports.

On 8 February, all classes did the Current Affair with Values Embedded (CAVE) lesson in order to prepare them for this disruption exercise. The students learnt about the importance of remaining resilience and resourceful during disruptions, followed by TDD fringe activities during recess on 15 and 16 February and a mass assembly programme on 16 February. Throughout the commemoration, the importance of playing one’s part to “Keep Singapore Strong” and ways to keep our nation strong through the 6 Pillars of Total Defence were reinforced and enacted through the activities. 

This year being TD40, three fringe activity stations were set up to reiterate the importance of being prepared for water, power and food disruptions. At Water Hunt station, the students learnt about Singapore’s national taps that constantly provides water in Singapore. At the Energy Hunt station, students participated in online quiz on energy saving before proceeding to a puzzle game or Lego activity. At the Food Hunt station, the students took up the challenge to look out for alternative food source for Singapore on the world map based on their choice scenario cards. Awareness and appreciation of different military and civil defence roles that keep our nation safe and secure were bolstered. Our younger lower primary students got to dress up as different frontliners for the Avatars of the Sg World station. At the Slam The Scam station, our students learnt how to strengthen digital defence by playing the Scambuster card game. Finally, students penned their pledge to defence Singapore at the Fabric of Nation station. 

We are blessed to have strong support from the Parent Support Group. Many parent volunteers came over to support and facilitate the fringe activities during recess. They, together with our staff, exemplified the spirit of Total Defence which is to involve every Singaporean playing a part, individually and collectively, to build a strong, secure and cohesive nation.
