Total Defence Day 2025&nbsp;
-----------------------
Imagine a world without electricity, where electrical appliances such as fans, lights and air-conditioners are not able to serve their purposes! To prepare our staff and students for disruptions, Junyuan Primary School went through an hour of power disruption on 17 February 2025 as part of Exercise SG Ready 2025, in commemoration of Total Defence Day (TDD) this year!

To provide our students with the head-heart-hands learning experience on TDD, a series of activities was organized. To begin with, on 6 February 2025, our students learnt about the tips to manage a power outage through the Current Affair with Values Embedded (CAVE) lessons taught in class. 

Our passionate CCE Ambassadors educated the school community on the TDD purposes via our mass Assembly programme as well as broadcast platform, Studio 91. They also promoted the fringe activities on 14 February 2025 to encourage their school mates to participate actively in the commemoration of TDD. 

During recess time on 14 and 17 February 2025, our school was turned into a hub of discovery and fun. At the booths for the fringe activities, our students embarked on an exciting journey in discovering about the six pillars of TDD:

1. Energy Saving: The air crackled with excitement as students battled it out with one another through an online quiz on energy saving. Screams of triumph and groans of defeat could be heard as each participant gained knowledge through an exciting way, enhanced by technology.

2. Food Hunt: Students dove into the world of uncovering Singapore’s alternative food sources. They learnt more about Singapore’s resilience on food security.

3. My TDD Pledge : At this booth, students made their commitment towards TDD by penning down their personal pledge on how they can contribute to TDD in their personal lives.
 
4. Safer Internet: In an age where the Internet has become an almost essential item in our daily lives, our tech-savvy students learned crucial tips to stay safe in the digital world.
 
5. Our SG Avatars: Using AI Gen App, our students were transformed virtually into soldiers, police and firefighters. They learnt how important our Singapore Armed Forces and Home Team are towards defending Singapore against any potential threats and ensuring the safety for everyone. 

The TDD commemoration would not be complete without the authentic experience of going through power disruption together as a school community. On 17 February 2025, our staff and students learnt to be adaptable without fans, lights and air-conditioning while appreciating what we have in Singapore.

The unceasing dedication of our teaching and non-teaching staff, and the unwavering support from our Parent Support Group had made the TDD experience a successful one. From experiencing power disruption to exploring food security, from pledging psychological resilience to mastering digital safety, Junyuan Primary School has exemplified the spirit of Total Defence, which is to involve every Singaporean in playing a part, individually and collectively, to build a strong, secure and cohesive nation.

Together We Keep Singapore Strong!
