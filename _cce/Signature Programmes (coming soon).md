## Signature Programmes

In our commitment to nurture our students to be Leaders of Character who are gracious, active and discerning, our Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) Department offers three programmes, CAVE, DYK and LIVES, to complement and supplement the CCE Curriculum.

<u><b><h5>Current Affairs with Values Embedded (CAVE) Programme</h5></b></u><br>
<b>CAVE Programme </b>is designed to help students grow into caring, informed citizens with a strong sense of belonging to Singapore. Using resources like Kindsville Times Junior, Kindsville Times Adventure, and A OK!, it instils school values and builds Civic, Global, and Cross cultural (CGC) skills. <br><br>
Grounded in the commemoration of the National Education events, Total Defence Day, International Friendship Day and Racial Harmony Day, the programme nurtures pride, unity, and respect for diversity and inclusivity. Students stay engaged with current affairs, reflect on national issues, and learn to contribute positively to Singaporeâ€™s future.

<u><b><h5>DYK (Did You Know) Programme</h5></b></u><br>
<b>DYK Programme</b>uses the Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS) to share heartwarming and inspiring stories, highlight what is happening in Singapore, and showcase meaningful activities students can take part in. An example of an inspiring story is about how a P6 student overcame his heart condition to sit for PSLE in 2024. Students reflected on qualities that he had to help him overcome challenges. 
DYK encourages a habit of reading widely from reliable, age appropriate sources and builds critical thinking through the coaching of <b>SURE</b> skills (<b>S</b>ource, <b>U</b>nderstand, <b>R</b>esearch, and <b>E</b>valuate) which guide students to check the reliability of sources and the validity of information. By combining uplifting local content with guided self-directed use of SLS, the programme helps students stay curious, discerning, and connected to Singapore.
