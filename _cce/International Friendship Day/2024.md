### International Friendship Day 2024&nbsp;
----------------------------------
Every year, our school commemorates International Friendship Day (IFD) on the third Friday of Term 2 to emphasise the importance of fostering friendships with our neighbouring countries, particularly within the ASEAN community. This year, we commemorated it on 4th April with the theme "Singapore in Asia". Students were treated to a captivating skit titled "Hope, A Lost Phone," which highlighted the importance of international friendship and mutual learning.

During recess on 4th and 5th April, students engaged in a variety of meaningful fringe activities aimed at enhancing their understanding and appreciation of ASEAN cultures. Facilitated by members of the Parents’ Support Group (PSG) and our CCE student ambassadors and monitors, students participated in popular games from ASEAN countries, including Tumbang Preso, a favourite among Filipino children. This game involved throwing a slipper at a bottle, showcasing the creativity and resourcefulness of children in making fun out of everyday items.

Additionally, students took part in differentiated art activities where they created Wau kite bookmarks or paper dolls dressed in traditional costumes from Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines. These activities sparked interest and admiration for the unique cultural designs. 

At the IFD quiz and ASEAN Match card game booths, students demonstrated their knowledge of ASEAN countries' cultures and characteristics as they were engaged in the interactive learning experiences.

Throughout the fringe activities, our CCE Ambassadors and Monitors played a crucial role in fostering friendships among peers by guiding them through the various activities. Overall, the celebration of International Friendship Day served as a platform for students not only to enjoy themselves but also to deepen their understanding and appreciation of cultural diversity and the importance of friendship and collaboration across borders.
