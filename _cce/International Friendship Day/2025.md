### International Friendship Day 2025: <br>Singapore – Forging Friendships in a Complex World&nbsp;
----------------------------------
Our school commemorated International Friendship Day (IFD) on 11 April 2025, in line with this year’s theme, “Singapore: Forging Friendships in a Complex World.” The commemoration aimed to help students appreciate the importance of building meaningful and respectful relationships with people from diverse cultures, particularly within the ASEAN community and understand the importance of openness to the international flow of trade, ideas and talent.

The commemoration began on 10 April 2025 with a digital drama show titled “We Are the Same After All.” The engaging performance highlighted how, despite differences in culture or background, people share common hopes and values. It encouraged students to develop empathy and understanding for others in a globalised world.

Recess activities were held during two days, on 10 and 11 April, to provide students with interactive experiences that deepened their understanding of ASEAN cultures and the importance of friendship across borders.

At the ASEAN Discovery Station in JY Village, students explored the cultures of the ten ASEAN countries through ICT-based activities; the Primary 3 to 6 students participated in an online challenge game, while Primary 1 and 2 students enjoyed an online matching game. These activities helped students learn about the diverse traditions and lifestyles of their peers across the region and encouraged cross-cultural appreciation and collaboration.

At the JY Eco hub, the station “Thank You, Friends of Singapore” provided a space for students to express gratitude to foreign workers who contribute significantly to our nation. After watching a video that offered insights into the lives of foreign workers, Primary 3 to 6 students wrote thank-you notes on Padlet, while Primary 1 and 2 students shared their messages on a magnetic board. These notes were displayed as a gesture of appreciation for the dedication and hard work of foreign friends living and working in Singapore.

At the “Hello, Friend!” station in JY Village, students watched videos of interviews with our international students, produced by our school’s student reporters. Through the videos, they learnt about various cultures, heard simple greetings in different languages and gained insight into daily life abroad. Students then practised saying “Hello” and “Thank you” with their peers, promoting respectful interactions and curiosity about the wider world. The nearby CCE Board showcased this year’s IFD theme and highlighted similarities between Singapore and Malaysia — including common food, traditions and ways to foster cross-cultural bonds.

Students also had the opportunity to play traditional games from ASEAN countries — Tumbang Preso from the Philippines and Kelereng from Indonesia. These games not only introduced students to the cultural play traditions of their ASEAN neighbours but also promoted teamwork and friendship through shared fun. Through the Kites of Friendship activity in the school field, students got to work in teams to fly kites, symbolising unity, joy and the spirit of friendship. 

Through these meaningful activities spread over two days, students deepened their understanding of cultural diversity and developed greater appreciation for the friendships that connect people within ASEAN and beyond. International Friendship Day 2025 was a joyful and enriching learning experience. It reminded us to embrace openness and opportunities for international cooperation as well as the importance of forging meaningful connections with our neighbouring countries, helping Singapore remain relevant in a complex world.
