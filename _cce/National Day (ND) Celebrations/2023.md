### National Day Celebrations 2023
------------------------------

On 8 August 2023, JYPS was awash in a sea of red and white, as staff and students came respondent in their National colour best to celebrate Singapore’s 58th Birthday. This year, we were thrilled to have our students from MOE Kindergarten participating in the celebration with us.

The celebration began with the observance ceremony. Everyone showed their utmost respect to our nation during this solemn ceremony as our Cub scouts marched in with the state flag; and paid careful attention to the National Day message by the Minister of Education, Mr Chan Chun Sing to play a more active role in the community to make the theme for this year NDP “Onward as One” a reality in their daily lives.

The celebration continued with an entertaining and fun-filled concert led by our talented teacher hosts, Mr Muru and Mrs Sarah Quek. What a time we had as we sang and clapped along in a rousing sing-along of our favourite National Day theme songs. There was so much enthusiasm from the students and parents from Parent Volunteer Group, during the “Don’t Forget The Lyrics” quiz segment. It helped that the CCE ambassadors, prefects and Cub scouts passionately assumed the role of motivators to lead the little ones, both the Primary Ones and kindergarten students, in the sing-along. Our P5 CCE ambassadors also did us proud as they confidently presented the P5 NE show montage to the whole school. The P5 cohort were proud that their class projects were highlighted at such an important event.

The celebration continued in class where students were engaged in classroom activities. One such activity was completing a crossword puzzle to reveal the meaning of the symbols on the “Onward as One” logo. Our P1s and K2s also had a fun time to construct Singapore Iconic places such as Cavenagh Bridge out of SG50 LEGO bricks.

Indeed, it was a special and meaningful celebration for the whole school. The togetherness shown by all the participants, both in the school hall and classrooms, embodied the theme for this year National Day “Onward As One!”
