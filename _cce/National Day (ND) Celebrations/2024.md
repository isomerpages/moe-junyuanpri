### National Day Celebrations 2024
------------------------------

“Wow! The real mascot of the “Dance of the Nation“ has appeared right in front of us! I want to hold his hand!” exclaimed Primary One students excitedly. On 8 August 2024, Junyuan Primary School was thrilled to celebrate Singapore’s 59th Birthday with August, the mascot. The students squealed with delight when August went from class to class to dance with them. It was indeed a memorable experience to meet August and have fun with him. 

Staff and students of Junyuan Primary School had gathered earlier in the school hall to celebrate our nation’s 59th birthday. During the Observance Ceremony, our Cub Scouts and student leaders led the school to pay solemn respect to our nation as we sang our National Anthem and recite the national pledge; and paid careful attention to the National Day message by the Minister of Education, Mr Chan Chun Sing, as he inspired us to take positive actions to shape our nation’s future and making this year NDP theme “Together, as One United People” a reality in our daily lives. 

The celebration continued with an entertaining and fun-filled concert led by our talented teacher hosts, Mr Muru and Mrs Sarah Quek. What a time we had as we sang and clapped along in a rousing sing-along of our favourite National Day theme songs. There was so much enthusiasm from the students and parents from Parent Volunteer Group, when they danced the “Dance of the Nation” in the hall. It helped that the Cub scouts passionately assumed the role of motivators to lead the little ones, both the Primary Ones and kindergarten students, in the sing-along. Our P5 CCE ambassadors also did us proud as they presented their experience at the P5 NE Show through a photo montage to the whole school. 

The celebration continued in class where students were engaged in classroom activities. Through the ‘Faces of Singapore’ activity, the Primary Four to Primary Six students flexed their creativity to capture the different aspects of Singapore spirt on the faces of a paper cube. Collaborating with one another, they stacked up their cubes to form a mini art installation.  Meanwhile, Primary One to Primary Three students were engaged in the Maritime Sticker Activity. Through this activity, the students strengthened their appreciation of how maritime development has brought prosperity to Singapore’s economy.  

Indeed, it was a special and meaningful celebration for the whole school. The togetherness shown by all the participants, both in the school hall and classrooms, embodied the theme for this year National Day “Together As One United People”
