### National Day Celebrations 2025
------------------------------

What a wonderful and comprehensive National Day celebration at Junyuan Primary School! On 8 August 2025, the school embraced the significance of Singapore's 60th year of independence with a thoughtful blend of Observance Ceremony and other creative activities.

This year’s National Day commemoration kicked off in the beginning of August with “SG60 InfoHunt” - an interesting quest for 6 facts about Singapore where students learnt more about the achievements of Singapore over her 60 years of independence in areas such as architecture, sports and environmental sustainability. The quest ended with a quiz where winners won limited edition of collaterals from the National Heritage Board. 

On 8 August, the celebration balanced solemnity with joy - from the dignified Observance Ceremony with the Cub Scouts and student leaders to the lively concert performances. During the Observance Ceremony, our Cub Scouts and student leaders led the school in paying solemn respect to our nation as we sang our National Anthem and recite the National Pledge. Thereafter, the National Day message by the Minister of Education, Mr Desmond Lee, was presented to the school. The message reflected on our 60 years of nation building to inspire our youth to play a stronger role in building our shared future. 

The National Day concert commenced with the P5 CCE Ambassadors sharing their NE Show experiences on behalf of the P5 students. It continued with an entertaining and fun-filled concert performed by the Modern Dance CCA , Music Interest Club (MIC) and Parent Support Group (PSG). The Drama Club's return with "The Rainbow Soup" was especially fitting for National Day, with its themes of friendship, teamwork, and celebrating differences that mirror Singapore's multicultural identity. The dances and songs put up by the Modern Dance CCA, MIC and the PSG's rousing rendition of "Singapore Town", were so entertaining that most of the audience grooved along spontaneously. The concert ended with an entertaining mass singing, led by our talented teacher hosts, Mrs Sarah Quek and Mr Muru. What a time we had as we sung and clapped along in a rousing sing-along of our favourite National Day theme songs. The concert demonstrated how the whole school community came together to celebrate SG60.

The celebration continued in class where students were engaged in classroom activities. Through ‘Our SG Reimagined’ activities, the Primary One to Primary Six students flexed their creativity to create a drawing (for P1 to P3) and a model (for P4 to P6) of Singapore in the future to showcase their vision of a sustainable, inclusive or exciting place for future generations to live in. These activities had sparked among the students some fascinating conversations about sustainability, inclusivity, and what they hope their country will become. It was heartwarming that they could share the values guiding their reimagined Singapore with the whole school.

The whole celebration had captured that "Majulah Singapura" spirit - everyone moving forward together, learning, creating, and celebrating as one school community. Our P1-P6 students will likely remember this 60th anniversary celebration for years to come, especially their visions of Singapore's future that they got to share with everyone.
