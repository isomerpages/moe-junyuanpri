Principal's Message
===================



<img src="/images/Principal.jpeg" style="width:35%">


Greetings and welcome to Junyuan Primary School!

In the years post-pandemic, we have been riding the waves of changes and opportunities in the new landscape. We challenged ourselves to imagine how we can make learning more engaging, more meaningful for all our children, from the little ones in our kindergarten to the about-to-turn teenagers in the upper primary levels. And without the restrictions that limited what we can do, some of our ideas ran a little “wild”.

Our colleagues started to re-imagine schooling to better nurture the children for the future. They have been integrating real-world issues into the curriculum to get the children to think more critically. In CCAs, the various groups are going beyond the boundaries of the school to engage the community, including exchange programmes with cluster schools. In other programmes – outdoor camps, learning journeys, VIAs, social emotional learning, overseas cultural exchanges, just to name some - our colleagues are exploring ways instil a joy of learning, to grow the children to be lifelong learners and leaders of character. The PSG too, has been kept busy. Together with our colleagues, we are initiating a support group for parents of children with learning needs so that we can proactively reach out to each other to better help our children grow. The PSG also started several grounds up initiatives to create a more holistic environment for the children. 

Why the need for different opportunities that offer a variety of learning experiences?

We believe every child is different, each with his own needs and her own talents. Therefore, we make it our mission to nurture every child in a vibrant learning environment, so that we provide a range of opportunities to match the equally broad spectrum of talents and needs of our children. We believe that school is a place for them to find out about themselves, about what they are good at, and how they can excel in talents they are endowed with.

Going forward, we will encourage them to dare try, to embrace struggles as part of learning, and to discover what they are able to do well and take the journey of lifelong learning towards their dream.

But we must never forget what is unseen because often what we can’t see are the anchors that serve as foundations. These are the foundations built from developing character, citizenship and shared values. They will always remain at the core of what we do as a school community. It is when we push the boundaries to explore further and to try that we need deeper anchors. They will re-orientate us when we venture a bit too far, as explorers tend to so, to help us learn when we fail, and to remind us to be grateful when we succeed.  

Wishing you and your family a fruitful year ahead!
