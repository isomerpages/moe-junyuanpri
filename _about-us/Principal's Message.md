Principal's Message
===================



<img src="/images/Principal.jpeg" style="width:35%">


<i>Hello and welcome to Junyuan Primary School!</i>

<i>We celebrated our 35th anniversary last year and as we take time to reflect on this milestone, we can truly be grateful for the shared experiences of every member of our school’s community.</i>

<i>Over the past few years, we needed to learn many new things, unlearn some old habits, and relearn some age-old wisdom and attitudes. These lessons are gifts that have shaped and taught us as a school community to better guide and teach our students to embrace the exciting opportunities that the post pandemic future holds for them. They also affirmed that certain fundamentals like nurturing good character and supporting students with caring relationships will not change, no matter what.</i>

<i>We have also been trying different ways to teach and to learn, some of which nudged by the challenges of the pandemic, as well as adding new learning spaces to enhance our schooling experiences. Together, we are seeing possibilities of what we can do as we guide our students into the future of learning.</i>

<i>Let’s help them imagine who they can be and what they can do as they learn and discover themselves and the world around them. Let them dare dream of an exciting and fulfilling future for themselves and the world they will inherit.</i>

<i>Let’s help them dare to try and find different ways to try again if they were to fail the first, second and perhaps even the third time.</i>

<i>Let’s help them to dare contribute and give to the family, the community, and the nation for a better future for all of us!</i>

Wishing you a fruitful year of learning in 2024!
