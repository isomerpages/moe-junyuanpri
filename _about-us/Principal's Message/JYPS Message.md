Greetings from Junyuan Primary School! 

This year, our guiding theme is <b>"Dare to Contribute – I can make a difference"</b>. This theme is a bold invitation for every child to step forward and use their unique strengths to build a better school community.

To truly "Dare to Contribute”, we want to guide our children to live out the four Desired Junyuan Outcomes that we hope will define the JYPS student.

Being a contributor starts with being a <b>Gracious and Active Citizen</b>. It means recognising that everyone can adopt a sense of agency — the power to choose how we act. We want to guide and challenge every child to choose to be an upstander, not a bystander. If they see something that needs to be done, or someone who needs help, they don't wait for others. Instead, they step up and take action with grace and kindness. Their choice to act is the first step in making a difference.

As they take up the challenge to be proactive, we want to help them be <b>Adaptable Individuals</b>. Making a difference isn't always easy; they will face unexpected obstacles and will need to make changes to their mindsets and approaches. The world is constantly evolving, and their ability to be flexible, resilient, and proactive in finding solutions will be key. Let's help them embrace change and see every difficulty as an opportunity to adapt and grow.

Taking on a challenge requires focus, discipline, and a commitment to lifelong learning. This is where they become <b>Self-Directed Learners</b>. To make the biggest impact, they must own the way they learn and grow. We will guide them to take the initiative to seek out the knowledge and skills they need, reflect on their actions, and continuously improve their ability to contribute. We will guide them to embrace their own growth.

Finally, we want to teach them to lead as <b>Confident Communicators</b> in making the school a better place for everyone to grow and glow. Once they have an idea, a solution, or a passion project, we want to walk alongside them to confidently communicate and persuade their peers to follow their lead. We want to help them speak up with clarity, share their vision with conviction, and inspire others to join them in the mission to make the school a better place for everyone.

We invite you to join us in this adventure to nurture in our children a sense of agency to make the school a better place for their friends and themselves. 

Wishing you and your family a great year ahead!

Best Regards<br>
Staff and Colleagues of JYPS
