Principal's Message
===================



<img src="/images/Principal.jpeg" style="width:35%">


Warm greetings to all stakeholders of Junyuan Primary School.

2019 has been a year of forging new friendships and bringing together the best practices of East View Primary and Junyuan Primary to grow and glow our pupils. We would like to thank Miss Chiam Lee Meng for her leadership in guiding us through this exciting and critical period of our school’s journey. We will build on Miss Chiam and her predecessors’ efforts, as well as what has been achieved for our pupils with the staff and parents.

Moving into 2020 and the years beyond, we will grow our Applied Learning Programme and Learning for Life Programme to develop the confidence and skills our pupils need to succeed in life. At the same time, we will continue to seek and explore ways to engage our pupils in preparing them to be Future-Ready Learners. We want to see their talents blossom by helping them foster a sense of joy and curiosity for lifelong learning. 

Yet some things will not change. The best safeguard for our children in an increasingly complex and ambiguous environment is to help them develop the values and character that will anchor them as their moral ballast when they navigate life’s opportunities and challenges. We hope to work with our parents and community stakeholders to grow our pupils holistically through our Character and Citizenship Education, leadership and well-being programmes. 

I am confident that our caring team of teachers and support staff, together with the partnerships with our SAC, parents and community stakeholders, will grow our pupils to be Future-Ready Learners and Leaders of Character.

We wish everyone a Happy New Year and a fruitful 2020!

 

Chan Weng Cheong <br>
