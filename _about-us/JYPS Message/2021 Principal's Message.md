Principal's Message
===================



<img src="/images/Principal.jpeg" style="width:35%">


Greetings from Junyuan Primary School!

How should we describe 2020?

The different learning environment using modes that are intuitive to many of our children may have provided some novelty for them at the start of the circuit breaker, but later became stressful to some because of the lack of the normal social interactions and support. Teachers had to accelerate their own learning to weave lessons online while taking on the unprecedented yet critical role of keeping the children safe in school during a global pandemic. Likewise, parents struggled to cope with working from home while trying their utmost to help their children learn. These were challenges that we could not have surmounted without the resilience and grit of all our stakeholders. We salute and thank all our staff, parents and children for partnering us in this very difficult season. 

As we enter 2021, we can distil some important lessons learnt from the experiences gleaned from last year to build a brighter future for our children. Indeed, there are many possibilities awaiting us, if we dare try.  We will work with our stakeholders to explore these possibilities to create a more vibrant environment for teaching and learning. In doing so, we hope to augment and enhance our existing programmes with a curriculum that supports the growth and development of the children to be Future-Ready Learners.

The pandemic also reminded us of many things that we have collectively known to be important, like the values that anchor and the home-school partnership that shelters our children as they grow through the storm. We will continue to nurture our children to be Leaders of Character through multiple platforms and collaborate with our parents and stakeholders in seeking to provide a congruent environment at home and in school for them to grow.  

Finally, we would also like to thank our Vice-Principal, Mrs Kwok Siew Lian for her many years of excellent service in educating generations of children and educators. We are grateful to have in her a caring leader, nurturing teacher and loving friend. We wish her a very fruitful retirement and many more good years ahead.

Wishing everyone a healthy and bright 2021!
