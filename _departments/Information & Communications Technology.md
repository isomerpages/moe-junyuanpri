The school currently has 3 air-conditioned computer laboratories. Each laboratory is equipped with 40 Intel Core i5-based computers. Our pupils are now able to spend more of their curriculum time using Information and Communication Technology with the completion of our new Project Work Room equipped with the IRT tables to facilitate Collaborative Learning. The room provides pupils with the necessary resources to complete their multimedia projects and for teachers to conduct ICT-based lessons. To enable our pupils to have easy access to computers, free access areas have been set up. The Junyuan Express aims to promote independent learning among our pupils and give them the opportunity to broaden their learning as they conduct research on their own. We are also pleased to announce that we have set up our very own Studio 91 and our pupils have had the opportunity to speak on the air and interviewed 2 Ministers who visited JYPS.
