Character & Citizenship Education
=================================

### Vision

Leaders of Character,  Gracious and Active Citizens

  

### Mission

To nurture every student to be caring, gracious and discerning

  

### Tagline

### Rationale

We strive to nurture our students to be:

 *   <b>Leaders of Character</b> who seek to exemplify our school values of **R3ICH,** enabled by **Social-Emotional Competencies**and 21st Century **Cross Cultural Civil Literacy Skills**.
*   <b>Active Citizens</b> who are **caring and gracious**, committed to do their bit to build a better nation for all; as well as **discerning**and grounded as they navigate through the challenges and influences encountered along the way to flourish and live fulfilling lives as individuals, family members, friends and citizens of Singapore

### Our Programmes:

We strive to enrich learning platforms and opportunities for students to understand who they are and who they can become. Our programmes are planned such that  every student, by the end of six years in JYPS,  is able to:

*   Distinguish right from wrong
*   Take responsibility for choices and actions
*   Be caring towards others and form healthy friendship with them
*   Be resilient when faced with challenges
*   Have a good sense of gratitude and appreciation
