International Friendship Day
===============================

### International Friendship Day 2021 NEW!


### International Friendship Day 2021 **NEW!**

International Friendship Day (IFD) is commemorated annually to remind our students the importance of building and strengthening friendships among our neighbouring countries (especially the ASEAN countries), deepening the connection with them, as well as nurturing the spirit of friendship and collaboration among different people.

Our school commemorated International Friendship Day (IFD) on 8 April based on the theme “Singapore in the World”, albeit taking the constraints of the Safe Management Measures of Covid-19 in our stride.

  

On that day, the whole school enjoyed watching virtual performances by our school’s Modern Dance CCA and MIC Group. Our talents artists, through their performances, showed how vibrant our ASEAN and International communities are.

After watching the lively digitalised concert, the students were engaged in meaningful class’s discussion on how Singaporeans have shown kindness towards migrant workers in the midst of coping with the COVID pandemic as a nation. This was to raise awareness the contributions made by our foreign friends living and working in Singapore.

To foster understanding and appreciation of the cultures of our ASEAN neighbours, the students participated in the fringe activities via the Student Learning Space (SLS). The students learnt about the different cultures, traditions and the way of life of the people in the other ASEAN countries. The Upper Primary did paper weaving, a traditional ASEAN craft, while the Lower Primary did the ASEAN Cloud, featuring the 10 ASEAN members on the Cloud.

### International Friendship Day 2019

Our school commemorated International Friendship Day (IFD) with a series of activities based on the theme of “Connected Communities” this year. Through these activities, our students were not only led to appreciate the importance of building and strengthening friendships among our neighbouring countries, especially the ASEAN countries, but also deepen the connection with them, as well as nurture the spirit of friendship and collaboration among different peoples.  
  
Fringe activities to foster understanding and appreciation of the cultures of our ASEAN neighbours were organised during recess in the second week of Term 2. Facilitated by parent volunteers from the Parents’ Support Group (PSG), the students participated in traditional games commonly played in other ASEAN countries such as “Semut, Orang, Gajah”, a version of “Scissors, Paper and Stone” played in Indonesia. They also experienced playing “Bamboo Jack”, a traditional game played in Vietnam and Cambodia. During the fringe activities, Primary 5 students entrenched their friendship with their Primary 1 buddies by participating in the activities together. To deepen our connections within the community, we also invited 46 kindergarteners to participate in the fringe activities on IFD as part of the K21 School Experience programme.  Our student leaders played buddy to the kindergarteners while participating in the fringe activities and class experience. If you were present at Junyuan Village on 8 April 2019, you would have observed them encouraging their charges to gyrate to the music of Thai Cha-Cha line dance and taking candid shots among the eight standees depicting the ethic costumes of the ASEAN countries.  
  
Last but not least, the students enjoyed a mass assembly concert which started off with a skit based on the book “Crow Boy” written by Taro Yashima which promotes the value of inclusivity among diversity. It spoke about the importance of respecting and accepting the differences amongst us. This value is reinforced through the fringe activity of Inclusivity Booth which promotes the awareness that each student is unique and has different needs and abilities. The concert ended with the singing of folk songs from ASEAN and an energetic performance from International Dance CCA group.
