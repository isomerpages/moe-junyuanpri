### International Friendship Day 2021 **NEW!**

International Friendship Day (IFD) is commemorated annually to remind our students the importance of building and strengthening friendships among our neighbouring countries (especially the ASEAN countries), deepening the connection with them, as well as nurturing the spirit of friendship and collaboration among different people.

Our school commemorated International Friendship Day (IFD) on 8 April based on the theme “Singapore in the World”, albeit taking the constraints of the Safe Management Measures of Covid-19 in our stride.

  

On that day, the whole school enjoyed watching virtual performances by our school’s Modern Dance CCA and MIC Group. Our talents artists, through their performances, showed how vibrant our ASEAN and International communities are.
