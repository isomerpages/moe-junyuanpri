Physical Education
==================

#### ‘Experience, Enjoy, Excel’

In Junyuan Primary School, the Physical Education (PE) curriculum and programmes aim to give every pupil an enriching EXPERIENCE during PE lessons so that they can ENJOY a lifetime of healthy and active lifestyle. Through the acquisition of these foundational physical skills and abilities, we also encourage and provide platforms for pupils to develop their talents so that they can EXCEL in sports.
