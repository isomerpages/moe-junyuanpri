### P3 Field-based Learning Journey to Butterfly Park & Insect Kingdom

  

In Term 2, the Primary 3 pupils went on a Field-based Learning Journey to the Butterfly Park & Insect Kingdom. Surrounded with lush tropical greenery, the park is one of the Asia’s largest collections of insects.  

  

The facilitators led the pupils into an intimate learning experience and taught them more about the insects. Many of pupils stepped forward eagerly to engage and interact with the butterflies and insects. There were other animals such as the iguana and parrots in the park, which provided pupils up-close encounters with different animals too. The focus was learning the life cycle of the butterfly. The students stepped into the hut where all the pupae of the butterflies were housed. They even get to see how some butterflies which just broke out from the pupa case, drying their wings before they take flight. 

  

The trip allows pupils to better relate what they have learnt in the syllabus (Diversity of Living and Non-Living Things) to real life experiences. It was an educational tour with the scents, sights and sounds of an authentic tropical rainforest that left the pupils in awe of these small magnificent insects.
