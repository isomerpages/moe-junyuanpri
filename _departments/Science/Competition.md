Two teams of Primary 5 pupils represented the school in the Marine Aquascaping Competition, held in conjunction with the East Zone STEM Festival at Victoria Junior College on 2 August 2019. The competition aims to raise awareness of the biodiversity of the marine ecosystem and the need for conserving and protecting the ocean. 

  

The pupils were undaunted, despite this being their first time participating in such an event. They put in a lot of effort researching on how to set up a Nano marine aqua system as well as on marine conservation issues. On the day of the competition, the pupils worked well as a team and were able to engage the judges during their presentation.  

  

The teachers were very heartened to see how the pupils took their own initiative to prepare for the competition and support one another. It was a meaningful and enjoyable day out for all of us involved.
