Science for Curious Minds

  

### DEPARTMENT FOCUS

  

The Science Department strives to provide our pupils with learning experiences to form scientific concepts using a ‘hands-on’, ‘minds-on’ approach aligned to the Inquiry Science Teaching. Our pupils acquire scientific literacy when they explore their natural environment and make connections to the real world through problem-solving and experimentation. We also encourage discovery learning at the different learning spaces on our school premise.

The 'hands-on, minds-on' Experiential Approach to learning Science through learning journeys and workshops will be part of Science learning for the P3 and P6 pupils. The learning journeys and workshop is linked to a theme that is covered in the Science Curriculum. Through these learning journeys, pupils are immersed in environments that allow them to observe and explore living organisms or science processes up close. It strengthens pupils’ concepts learnt in the various topics and enriches their learning experiences beyond the classroom to make learning meaningful and authentic.
