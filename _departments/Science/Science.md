Science for Curious Minds

  

### DEPARTMENT FOCUS

  

The Science Department strives to provide our pupils with learning experiences to form scientific concepts using a ‘hands-on’, ‘minds-on’ approach aligned to the Inquiry Science Teaching. Our pupils acquire scientific literacy when they explore their natural environment and make connections to the real world through problem-solving and experimentation. We also encourage discovery learning at the different learning spaces on our school premise.
