Cyber Wellness
==============


### **Cyber Wellness 101**

##### **What is Cyber Wellness?**

Cyber Wellness (CW) refers to the positive well-being of Internet users. It involves an understanding of online behaviour and awareness of how to protect oneself in cyberspace. The focus of CW is about helping students to become responsible digital learners. When navigating cyberspace, students should demonstrate respect for self and others and practise safe and responsible use. Students should also be a positive peer influence by harnessing technology for collaboration, learning and productivity, as well as advocating positive use of technology for the good of the community.

##### **MOE Cyber Wellness Framework**

MOE uses the CW framework to develop the child’s instinct to protect and empower him to take responsibility for his own well-being in cyberspace. The three principles, ‘Respect for Self and Others’, ‘Safe and Responsible Use’ and ‘Positive Peer Influence’ when adhered to will anchor a child’s well-being in cyberspace as he will then be able to make careful and well-considered decisions.

**Principles**

**(1) Respect for Self and Others** 

Students need to:

*   uphold their own dignity when online (e.g. share appropriate content and participate in only legal online activities) 
*   respect other people online (e.g. put themselves in others’ shoes, accept diverse views and opinions, give credit when using other people’s work and seek permission where necessary, avoid sharing hurtful materials).

**(2) Safe and Responsible Use** 

Students need to:

*   have an understanding of the risks of harmful and illegal online behaviour, and take steps to protect themselves (e.g. keep their personal information private, verify the reliability of information using various sources, take steps to avoid dangers they may encounter online). 
*   make wise and healthy choices (e.g. maintain a healthy balance of their online and offline activities)

**(3) Positive Peer Influence**

Students need to:

*   be a positive role model online (e.g. share healthy and positive content, harness the affordances of technology to do good for society)
*   advocate positive online behaviour (e.g. stand up for their peers online, report cases of cyber bullying to a trusted adult/authority, post encouraging remarks on social media)

### **Parenting Tips**

To complement the cyber wellness curriculum in schools, parents can set a good example at home in the use of technology and play an active role in guiding our children to navigate in cyberspace.  Here are the steps for PARENTing in the digital age:

Some basic rules could include the following:

Do's:

  

*   seek permission before using computing devices
*   have a time limit for the use of computing devices
*   practice netiquette on the Internet
*   respect intellectual property right
*   follow rules and terms of use of different websites


Dont's:

  

*   access websites that have age restrictions (for e.g. many social media sites have age limit for setting up accounts to comply with international regulations on children accessing social media).
*   share password with others
*   share personal information online
*   meet strangers face to face without parents’ knowledge
*   spread rumours and say mean things online

*   Surf the Internet with your child so that you know what he/she does online and whether he/she is involved in age-appropriate activities. This will help to hone your child’s skills to translate his/her understanding into actions which he/she can later apply should he/she face similar situations.
*   Highlight to your child not to respond to anyone who says something inappropriate and he/she should immediately leave any site if he/she feel uncomfortable.

*   Get your child to share with you his/her favourite online websites, things he/she do online and what is cool amongst his/her friends.
*   Talk to him/her about his/her online experiences. (For example, discuss about the benefits and risks of the Internet, share how people connect and communicate with one another through the Internet).
*   Let your child know that it is alright to ask you questions or talk to you if he/she run into problems with someone online.
*   Download the [C-Quest game app](http://ictconnection.moe.edu.sg/cyber-wellness/for-parents/resources/c-quest), which facilitates conversation between parents and children on cyber wellness, from the iTunes Store / Google Play.
