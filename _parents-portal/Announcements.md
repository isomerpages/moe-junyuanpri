### MOE Edusave Character Award (ECHA) 2022


MOE introduced the ECHA in 2012 to enable schools to recognise students who demonstrate exemplary character and outstanding personal qualities through their behaviour and actions. The award also supports schools’ continuing efforts in nurturing students of good values and character, who are active contributors and concerned citizens. ECHA is awarded for students’ real-life demonstration of character and good values in the year of the award.

ECHA Nomination Criteria:

• Student must be a Singapore Citizen;

• Demonstrate exemplary and consistent behaviour;

• Possess a high level of civic responsibility and/or qualities associated with resilience.

We have formulated a rigorous, robust and fair selection process based on the guidelines and criteria provided by MOE. The 4 main stages in the selection process are

(i) nomination;

(ii) shortlisting of nominees by level teachers;

(iii) selection of the final awardees by a panel headed by the Principal;

(iv) endorsement by the Principal and representatives from key stakeholders.
