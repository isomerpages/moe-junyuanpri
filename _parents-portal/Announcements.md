### MOE Edusave Character Award (ECHA) 2022


MOE introduced the ECHA in 2012 to enable schools to recognise students who demonstrate exemplary character and outstanding personal qualities through their behaviour and actions. The award also supports schools’ continuing efforts in nurturing students of good values and character, who are active contributors and concerned citizens. ECHA is awarded for students’ real-life demonstration of character and good values in the year of the award.

ECHA Nomination Criteria:

• Student must be a Singapore Citizen;

• Demonstrate exemplary and consistent behaviour;

• Possess a high level of civic responsibility and/or qualities associated with resilience.

We have formulated a rigorous, robust and fair selection process based on the guidelines and criteria provided by MOE. The 4 main stages in the selection process are

(i) nomination;

(ii) shortlisting of nominees by level teachers;

(iii) selection of the final awardees by a panel headed by the Principal;

(iv) endorsement by the Principal and representatives from key stakeholders.

In addition to the MOE Edusave Character Award, the school will continue to recognise students who are good role models with school-based award – the JYPS Character Award. These awardees will be selected based on similar criteria for ECHA and would include non-Singaporeans.

Teachers, parents and students are welcome to nominate deserving Junyuan Primary School students for the award. The nominees will be interviewed by a panel consisting of the school middle managers, school leaders and stakeholders (Alumni and Parent Support Group).

As our key partner-in-education, we invite you to nominate suitable students for ECHA.

You may nominate online via [https://go.gov.sg/jypsecha2022](https://go.gov.sg/jypsecha2022)

Nominations will open from Monday, 8 August 2022 to Friday, 2 September 2022.
