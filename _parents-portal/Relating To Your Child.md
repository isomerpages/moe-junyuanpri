##### Feelings Thermometer: A Helpful Tool for You and Your Child

We often use the thermometer to understand one’s current physical health, but did you know that it could be applied as a tool to measure feelings as well? The Feelings Thermometer is a visual scaling and research-based tool that can help children to  
  
1.  Build self-awareness
2.  Manage their feelings
3.  Develop perspectives

Using a Feelings Thermometer, children learn to identify what they are feeling, and understand the intensity of the feeling. It helps them to see when they are escalating and learn to use a coping skill to manage the feeling!  
  
In support of the Race to Praise Campaign by Focus on The Family SG, we would like to encourage you to connect and affirm your child this Children’s Day! In our October school bulletin, we have distributed an activity sheet, which provides a meaningful opportunity for you child to discuss about emotions and how to manage small, medium or big emotions.
