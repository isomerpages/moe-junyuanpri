The JYPS Choir is under the baton of Miss Lim Beena. The choir aims to provide a platform for students who have a passion for singing to learn the different genres of music as well as sing with confidence during performances. Activities are mostly held in the schoolâ€™s Music Room. Other programmes include exchange with other choirs and concerts.
