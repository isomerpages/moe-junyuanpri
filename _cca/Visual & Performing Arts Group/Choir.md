The JYPS Choir is under the baton of Miss Lim Beena. The choir aims to provide a platform for students who have a passion for singing to learn the different genres of music as well as sing with confidence during performances. Activities are mostly held in the school’s Music Room. Other programmes include exchange with other choirs and concerts.
