Chinese Dance
=============

![](/images/ChineseDance.jpeg)

Chinese Dance allows students to learn dance moves, proper stretching, warm-up techniques and how to co-operate with one another. Students will be increasingly confident through the performances they take part in both school and community events. Given such opportunities, students will also build up their showmanship. Students who are selected to perform in the SYF Arts Presentation biennially are able to showcase their dance performances and get recognition for their effort and training.
