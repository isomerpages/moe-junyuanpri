We aim to develop our members into graceful and skilled dancers, and confident performers. The pupils will learn the 5 basic traditional Malay dance moves â€“ Asli, Inang, Joget, Masri & Zapin. The pupils will be given the opportunity to showcase their talents during school events and in the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF).
