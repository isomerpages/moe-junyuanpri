CCAs
====

##### &nbsp;**1.&nbsp;<u>Objectives of Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) in JYPS</u>**  
    
<b>To promote the discovery of interests through exposure and talents in specialization.</b>


Our <b><u>Physical Sports CCA</u></b> groups develop resilience, fair play and team spirit in students through developing their sports-specific skills so that they can appreciate and enjoy playing the game. They will also have the opportunity to train and condition themselves towards competitive play in the annual National School Games.&nbsp;

Our <b><u>Visual and Performing Arts</u></b> groups instill in our students a sense of graciousness and an appreciation for the rich culture and heritage of our multi-racial &amp; multi-cultural society.&nbsp;

Our <b><u>Uniformed Groups</u></b> instill citizenship in our students by inculcating in them self-reliance, resilience, discipline and a spirit of service to others.&nbsp;

Our <b><u>Clubs and Societies</u></b> allow our students to explore and extend their interests in information, communication and subject-specific skills as they strive to grow their mastery in these specialised areas.&nbsp;

All our CCAs offer excellent platforms for students to learn core values, social and emotional competencies and the emerging 21st Century Competencies. Beyond the pursuit and development of interest and individual talent, our CCA programmes are also customized to:&nbsp;

  1\. Instill a strong and meaningful sense of identity and belonging to Junyuan Primary School as well as developing bond with peers and teachers.&nbsp;


2\. Nurture our students to demonstrate the 4 Desired Junyuan Outcomes (DJOs) through an engaging and relevant CCA programme.
 

3\. Develop our students to be Future-Ready Learners and Leaders of Character.**

##### **2.2 <u>Selection of CCA</u>**  

All P3-P6 pupils are strongly encouraged to participate in only 1 CCA of their choice.

Before selecting a CCA, P3 students will be given the opportunity to participate in a non-compulsory CCA Experience programme in Term 1. The P3&nbsp;CCA&nbsp;Experience allows the students to discover their interests and talents by attending trial&nbsp;CCA&nbsp;sessions from&nbsp;<b><u>selected CCAs only</u></b>.

All P3 students will participate in a CCA Selection Exercise in Term 2 and start in their CCA officially in Term 3.

Transfer-in students will be allowed to select a CCA on an adhoc basis depending on the time that they become a Junyuan student.


##### **2.3 <u>Participation</u>**  

All P3-P6 pupils are strongly encouraged to participate in only 1 CCA of their choice as CCA requires effort and commitment. The school seeks to ensure that its students can manage both CCA and studies as well as excel in both areas.

One of the ways that a Junyuan student can demonstrate effort and commitment in his/her CCA is by ensuring good attendance. Students are required to be present for <b><u>at least 75% of their CCA sessions</u></b>.

Attendance is compulsory at every CCA session. If a student is to be absent from CCA, his/her absence should be supported with a medical certificate, written letter/email or a text via ClassDojo.


##### **2.4 <u>Change of CCA</u>**  

A student who has successfully registered for a CCA are strongly encouraged to
remain committed in that CCA until the end of the year. This will give the students
time to develop and hone their skills.

To minimise disruption in the running of CCA programmes and activities in the
year, please refer to the table below on the guidelines to request for change of
CCA.
