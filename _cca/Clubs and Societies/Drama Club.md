Drama Club
==========

![](/images/Drama.jpeg)


The Drama Club was formed in 2013. Currently, there are 15 members from Primary 4 to 6. The club aims to equip members with acting skills and provide them with the opportunities to showcase the skills they have learnt through various competitions and performances. They will also be able to discover their hidden talents, boost their level of confidence and become a more confident communicator. Ultimately, the clubâ€™s goal is to inculcate a love for drama in its members.
