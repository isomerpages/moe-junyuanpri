Tchoukball, which is invented in late 1960 by Dr Hermann Brandt, is the fastest hand ball sport in the world today.  
  
Junyuan Primary started Tchoukball as a CCA in 2012. It is an active and fun sport that allows players to experience team work, increase their self-confidence and inculcate values like respect and integrity. It is a non-contact sport whereby it allows all pupils of differing shapes and sizes to play together. Pupils will be taught the basic skills required like passing, catching and shooting. Some pupils will also have an opportunity to take part in the SPH Foundation Zonal and National Championships.
