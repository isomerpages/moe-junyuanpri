<font size="14" face="Comic Sans MS">Our new Primary 1 students had an <font color="#A02B93" face="Curlz MT">amazing</font> time during <font color="#FF0000" face="Harrington">recess</font> on the first day of school, all thanks to their <font face="#00B050" color="#00B050">fantastic </font> Primary 4 buddies!<br><br>The P4s did not just help their P1 friends buy food—they went the extra mile by showing them around the school canteen, teaching them where to return their trays, and pointing out important spots like the restrooms, the bookshop, the school library, and the eco garden. They also introduced the P1s to the drink stall, showed them where to buy Halal food, and even shared tips on where to get the best chicken rice (and how much it costs!). It was like having their very own tour guides!<br>The P1s enjoyed themselves so much and they wrote thank-you cards to their P4 buddies. <br>Let us hear what some of them had to say about the recess experience on the First Day of School!</font>
